# Assignment: ðŸŽ° Slot

## ðŸ“– Description

The task involves creating a small game based on the provided Photoshop file and the resources available in the repository. You can find the download link for the Photoshop files in the ðŸ”— Resources section. When you clone the project, you will receive all the remaining required materials.

### The Photoshop file includes:

- 10-line board
- Spin button
- ðŸŸ§ Turbo Spin button
- Bet selection buttons (there is also a popup, which is disabled)
- Balance, ðŸŸ© Win, and Bet sections

## ðŸŽ® Game Mechanics

- The player selects the desired bet and then presses the spin button.
- By default, a bet is already selected.
- Symbols pay from left to right on the 10-line board.
- The game has a multiplier wheel (1x, 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x):
  - Starts spinning when the spin begins
  - Stops before the first reel stops
  - When the spin begins, all reels start spinning without waiting for the API response.

### Winning Logic

- If the spin is winning:
  - Show multiplier wheel animation (the winning amount appears in the center of the wheel) and corresponding symbol animations.
- If the win > 3x the bet â†’ show Big Win animation.
- If the win â‰¤ 3x â†’ show regular ðŸŸ© Win.
- Winning lines are provided in the Photoshop file and must be applied to the board accordingly.

## ðŸŒ€ Special Symbols

- **Wild**
  - When it appears in a win, it expands and fills the entire reel, other symbols disappear.
  - In the returned response (`Baraban: []`), the Wild index is marked with ðŸŸ¦ 0.
  - The sequence of other symbols by index does not matter.
  - Every symbol has its own win animation.

### ðŸŸ§ Turbo Spin Mode

- Reel spinning and the multiplier wheel are also accelerated.

## ðŸ”Œ API

The project includes a file `fake.api.js` with a function `GetBoard`:

- Returns an object containing:
  - Balance
  - Win
  - Reel information
  - Multiplier value
- `GetBoard` receives the selected bet amount.
- If no parameter is provided, it returns the current information.

## ðŸ“± Resolution & Adaptation

- ðŸŸ¥ The game must scale proportionally on all devices and also have a mobile version.
